# SP2-Udvikling_af_store_systemer

## The project board 
We chose to use a kanban board as our templete becuase we have worked with kanban boards before and find them easy to use.

## Issues
Issues are the tasks we'll be working on during this assignment. This means that any work done should be made into an issue. In other words: Issues will be function as our features, bugfixes and documentation tasks. These types of tasks will be made into labels. Enabling us to easier differentiate between the issues and tell them apart. If an issue has multiple steps (i.e the issue has a need to be seperated into smaller manageble pieces possibly due to scale or complexity) we'll then create suptasks inside the Issue as a way of handling this. We will also make use of draft issues to contain our user stories. This way we know what user stories we are working on, in this current sprint. Draft Issues wil onlly be left in the backlogs for as long as they are in the draft state.

## Pull Requests
Draft pull requests is utilized in a way to indicate that an issue is beening worked on. but isn't ready for review yet. When it comes out of draft it means the pull request is ready for review. when the pull request is approved or has underwent the nescessary changes it can then be merged into our main branch/production.
Pull requests will have issues attached and when successfully merged the attached issues should be closed/resloved in github projects, this is a way to keep track of issues via pull requests.
## Labels 
As we mentioned labels will just be used to label what kind of task the issue is. Here are our labels: 
 - Feature
 - Documentation
 - Bugfix
