# SP2-Udvikling_af_store_systemer

## The project board 
We chose to use a kanban board as our templete becuase we have worked with kanban boards before and find them easy to use.

## Issuses
Issuse are the tasks we will work on during the project. This means any work done should be made into an issuse. In other words issuses are our features, bugfixes and documentation tasks. These types of tasks will be made into labels this way telling dfferent issuses apart. If an issuse has multiple steps we will create suptasks inside the issuse. We will use draft issuse to contain our user stories. This way we know what user stories we are working on in this current sprint. Draft issuse will not leave the backlog. 

## Pull Requests
We will use draft pull request to show that an issuse is beening worked on. When it comes out of draft it means the pull request is ready for review. when the pull request is merge into main then the issuse it refered ti should be resloved.
